# bluegrss

Updated and tweaked version of the old Gregarius RSS reader, with features from the older MagpieRSS.

Primary purpose is to make a very simple and stripped down RSS reader, working fine across platforms, with the same display on desktop and mobile, without themes, plugins, languages and stuff.

There may exist several security issues in this code, as it is quite old. It is recommended to use your own layers of protection on top of the code, e.g. use it on your internal network only, use it along with VPN, a simple Apache login prompt or similar.

Please report any security issues - as well as any other nice contributions :-)
