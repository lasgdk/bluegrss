# bluegrss

Updated and tweaked version of the old Gregarius RSS reader, with features from the older MagpieRSS.

Primary purpose is to make a very simple and stripped down RSS reader, working fine across platforms, with the same display on desktop and mobile, without themes, plugins, languages and stuff.
